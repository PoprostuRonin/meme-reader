# Meme reader
## Browse memes sites without bloatware

**Note:** This project is still in early development, but it is useful as it is now.

### What is purpose of this project?
To be able to browse meme sites without tones of JS scripts, ads, tracking and horrible galleries.

### How it works?
Client page make request to API endpoint ([memes-api](https://github.com/PoprostuRonin/memes-api)) as you select one of available websites, then it parses the result and displays it as nice combination of pure HTML and CSS appropriate to selected website.
